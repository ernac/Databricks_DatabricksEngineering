    "Think of it as a data quality factory. Its main job is to take data that is \"raw and dirty\" and progressively transform it into \"clean and aggregated\" data that is reliable and easy to use for business analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"factory\" has three distinct quality layers, named after medals: Bronze, Silver, and Gold."

    "\n",
    "The Golden Rule: The data in the Bronze layer should be an exact, unaltered copy of the source data. You do not clean, filter, or change anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## KEY CHARACTERISTICS\n",
    "**STATE:** Raw, messy, \"dirty.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**PURPOSE:** To be a historical archive or \"staging area.\" If there is ever a problem in your downstream tables (Silver or Gold), you can always rebuild them by re-running your code on the raw Bronze data, without having to ask the source system for the data again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE (Code):** This is exactly what your COPY INTO command did in our earlier steps. It took a raw CSV file and landed it in a Delta table. That table is a perfect Bronze table."
