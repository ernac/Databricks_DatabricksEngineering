Data sets larger than that either can't fit into the memory of a single computer or take an unacceptably long time for a single computer to process. For these types of \"big data\" use cases, we need a system that can split a large data set into smaller subsets &mdash; often referred to as **partitions** &mdash; and then distribute the processing of these data partitions across a number of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an open-source data processing engine that manages distributed processing of large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say that we have a large data set and we want to calculate various statistics for some of its numeric columns. With Apache Spark, our program only needs to specify the data set to read and the statistics that we want calculated. We can then run the program on a set of computers that have been configured to serve as an Apache Spark **cluster**. When we run it, Spark automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* determines how to divide the data set into partitions,\n",

You can restore previous versions if needed, and it also allows for branching and merging of a project where you can create different versions of a project focused on developing different features and then combine them back together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a tool that can be run on your local machine or on Databricks to help with version control, but it shines as a collaboration tool when combined with [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git code repositories, and it allows multiple users to download versions of a project, develop for the project, and then push back their changes. These changes can then be merged, so this creates an easy system for collaboration that forms the backbone of code projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open Source technology is usually available as a public Github Repository where anyone can download the code and help develop it. For instance, Apache Spark is open source and you can view all its code, download it, and even help create new features all from its GitHub page [here](https://github.com/apache/spark)."
